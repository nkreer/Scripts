# Scripts

This repository contains all scripts I personally use as commands with my [Scripts-Plugin](https://github.com/nkreer/Fish-Scripts) for the Fish IRC-Bot, but they can be used like any other PHP script on the command line. Just fill `$argv[1]` and `$argv[2]` with something random.

| spotify.php			| Get song previews |
| fact.php			| Random fact from numbersapi.com |
| catfact.php			| Random cat fact from catfacts-api.appspot.com |
