# Scripts

This repository contails all scripts I personally use with my [Scripts-Plugin](https://github.com/nkreer/Fish-Scripts) for the Fish IRC-Bot.

| Script 				| Description			|
|-------------------|-------------------|
| wiki.php			| Wikipedia searches|
| gif.php				| Gif searches via Giphy |
| spotify.php			| Get song previews |
| fact.php			| Random fact from numbersapi.com |
| coffee.php        | Makes the bot give coffee |
| slap.php			| Slaps a user with something random |

If you wish to add your scripts to the list, feel free to do so via a pull request. I welcome every contribution.
